Students are not expected to have any prior knowledge in coding before they take this course. Students are expected to be able to collaborate with peers throughout various projects during the year. Students will learn coding language and frameworks including HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Skills in layout and design will also be developed throughout the year, as students will learn how to use basic software such as Adobe Photoshop. Students will work on different project based learning experiences as the year progresses and get a feel for what it would be like to design a web page for a potential future client. -Ms. Leonard",

Having just learned HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and more importantly web design, Web 2 offers students the ability to learn how to make their webpages interactive. We use JavaScript to do this. JavaScript is the language that lets code be interactive. In order to learn how to use JavaScript, students in Web Design also have to learn how to think like a programmer so it involves a lot of learning programmatic structures, sequence selection of repetition, but abstraction is how to create algorithms and functions. All skills can relate to various aspects of computer science, but they are taught through the design lens. -Mr Kilgore",

Students then take both of these skill paths and combine them to create functional 'real world' websites. Senior year revolves around four main projects, two of which come from NJIT and involve the application of JavaScript frameworks jQuery and Vue.js. One of the other two is a senior portfolio, which encompasses virtual recordkeeping of all work done by students during the time in the program. The final project in level 3 is a student center learning project where students explore the complete process of website design and development through an in class internship where they will go and find a real world client and then identify, design, and build a functioning website for their client. This will be based on their discussions, recommendations, and research with that client.",
