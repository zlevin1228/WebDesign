Students are not expected to have any prior knowledge in coding before they take this course. Students are expected to be able to collaborate with peers throughout various projects during the year. Students will learn coding language and frameworks including HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Skills in layout and design will also be developed throughout the year, as students will learn how to use basic software such as Adobe Photoshop. Students will work on different project based learning experiences as the year progresses and get a feel for what it would be like to design a web page for a potential future client. -Ms. Leonard",

        "teacherDescription": "Web Design 2 is designed to take students into their second year of their coding experiences. Having just learned HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and more importantly web design, Web 2 offers students the ability to learn how to make their webpages interactive. We use JavaScript to do this. JavaScript is the language that lets code be interactive. In order to learn how to use JavaScript, students in Web Design also have to learn how to think like a programmer so it involves a lot of learning programmatic structures, sequence selection of repetition, but abstraction is how to create algorithms and functions. All skills that can relate to various aspects of computer science, but they are taught through the design lens.",
